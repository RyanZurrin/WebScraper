# WebScraper
Simple C++ web-page scraper

A simple c++ webscraper built using the cpr and gumbo libraries, both available from vcpkg. This was a simple online tutorial I followed along too 
so it is fairly simple and only scrapes a single page. I would like to add functionaliy that would allow it to do much more at some point. This
project was built using Visual Studio 2019 Enterprise using the x86 debug mode as well you will need to  install the two previously mentioned libraries.
